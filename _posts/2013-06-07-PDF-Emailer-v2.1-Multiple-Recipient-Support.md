PDF Emailer is a iOS utility app that lets you email PDF and Office documents from Safari using a customizable email template.

In version 2.1, you can now set multiple recipients in your template by separating them with spaces.

PDF Emailer v2.1 is _(no longer)_ available for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch
