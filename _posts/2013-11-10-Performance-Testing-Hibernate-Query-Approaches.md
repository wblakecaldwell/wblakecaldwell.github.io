title: "Java: Performance Testing Hibernate Query Approaches"

I've known [entities are expensive]({% post_url 2013-11-08-Exercising-Caution-With-Hibernate-Entities %}), 
but wanted to see for myself, so 
[I built this test project](https://github.com/wblakecaldwell/hibernate-perf-test) to run some benchmarks. 
The tests aren't complete - just a simple query with no joins, but with a lot of data. The point was to see 
how much overhead is introduced after we have the query results.

## About the Project

This is a simple Maven Spring project that creates an in-memory HSQLDB database, populates it 500,000 records, and then uses several Hibernate query strategies to fetch every one, and report on their average execution times.

## Approaches Tested

1. Using a [JpaRepository](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/dev/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html) interface's 
[findAll](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/dev/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html#findAll) method to return a list of attached Hibernate entities.

2. Using Hibernate's [StatelessSession](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en-US/html/batch.html#batch-statelesssession) interface to return a list of detached Hibernate entities.

3. Selecting the specific fields of the entity, using Hibernate to return a simple List<Object[]>, and then manually converting that list to a list of detached entities (as DTOs, basically).

4. Selecting the specific fields of the entity, then using Hibernate's [AliasToBeanResultTransformer](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/api/org/hibernate/transform/AliasToBeanResultTransformer.html) to build a list of detached entities (as DTOs, basically).

## Changing Execution Parameters


By default, the database is loaded with 500,000 records, and each test is repeated in its own transaction 10 times. You can change both of these values in [src/main/resources/application.properties](https://github.com/wblakecaldwell/hibernate-perf-test/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties).

## Running Tests

This big of a database does take up over 256MB of memory, so you might have to increase your heap space. If you run the tests from Maven, you should be fine, since I increase it in the plugin's settings.

Download the sample project and run the following command from inside its directory:

  	mvn clean test

The test might take several minutes to run. At the end, the test will output the results.

## My Results

The results are listed slowest to fastest:

{% highlight text %}
---------------------------
Testing JpaRepository query
Total # of runs: 10
JpaRepository avg time: 1073.5ms

---------------------------
Testing stateless session query
Total # of runs: 10
Stateless Session avg time: 818.5ms

---------------------------
Testing RowData query
Total # of runs: 10
RowData avg time: 317.7ms

---------------------------
Testing ResultTransformer query
Total # of runs: 10
ResultTransformer avg time: 311.9ms
{% endhighlight %}
  

The individual times will vary on different systems - the relative performance is what's important. 

The `StatelessSession` query was a little more efficient than returning attached entities, but still pretty 
slow for this big query. The `AliasToBeanResultTransformer` and my custom `List<Object[]> -> DTO` approaches 
tied as the best performers. I was hoping for this result, but worried that the reflective nature of 
`AliasToBeanResultTransformer` might have introduced some overhead. It did not.


## Problems? Let me know!

I tried being as careful as I could with these tests:

- took the average of several test runs
- turned off Hibernate's second-level cache
- turned off Hibernate's query cache
- cleared the entity manager before each run
- ran each test in its own transaction
- ignored the first query in the transaction as to avoid any initial performance hit from opening it
 
I encourage you to download the project, take a look at the code, and try it out for yourself. If you see 
any issues with my methodology, please 
[let me know](https://github.com/wblakecaldwell/hibernate-perf-test/issues), and I'll correct for it.
